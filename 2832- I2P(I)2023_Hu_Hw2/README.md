# For 13969 - Frieren and Magic - 0 for lowercase and 1 for uppercase

According to 

**"Follow-up 2: How will you solve it if the character is assigned in the reverse order? Maybe it'll appear in your lab next Monday!"**

As a result, I predict that there might be a problem about **"If the signed bit is 0, make it lowercase;If the signed bit is 1, make it uppercase."**,and I add a file about that problem!

You can refer to it as you need!
