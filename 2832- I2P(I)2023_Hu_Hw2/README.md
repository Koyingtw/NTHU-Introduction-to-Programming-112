# For 13969 - Frieren and Magic - 0 for lower and 1 for upper-

According to 

**"Follow-up 2: How will you solve it if the character is assigned in the reverse order? Maybe it'll appear in your lab next Monday!"**

There might be a problem about "If the signed bit is 0, make it lowercase;If the signed bit is 1, make it uppercase."
So I add a file about that problem!
You can refer to it as you need!
